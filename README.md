## One Sentence Description
gloqo.com, the missing companion website for arXiv.org to search for code for research papers on arXiv.org

## Longer Description
This is basically the "Google” for searching code for computer science papers on arXiv. It’s currently concentrated on deep learning and machine learning. I started this companion website to arXiv.org to encourage reproducible research. You can easily search for code that are implemented by the authors themselves or often by others.

## Why did I Start Gloqo?
As an undergraduate conducting research in deep learning, I actively try to verify past papers’ experiments before building on them for major projects and papers. And I found that many, if not most, authors do not release their codes. And there are many issues associated with research that is not reproducible as shown in [Nature Reproducible Research](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552).

And because I ran out of ways to extend my [personal website](http://www.ritchieng.com) that is proudly served through Github Pages, I decided to just host this separate application where anyone can add new code for research papers. Although I believe initially I would be the only one using this.

## [Science Code Manifest](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org)
All source code written specifically to process data for a published paper must be available to the reviewers and readers of the paper.

## Help Wanted
1. I am looking for anyone to simply add on their code if they have written any for research papers, in particular deep learning and machine learning. It probably takes less than 5 minutes to add one record on [gloqo](https://www.gloqo.com).
2. You can simply star this repository and share to promote reproducible research.

## Format of Code Record
1. Go to [www.gloqo.com](https://www.gloqo.com)
2. Title of the post: Paper's name (programming language/library)
3. Content of the post: you can copy the following template, paste into your post, and change the necessary parts. It would take less than 5 mins.
```
1. [Code link](add link here!)
2. [Paper link](add link here!)
3. Programming Language: **Python**
4. Main Library: **TensorFlow**
5. Authors: **Add name(s) here!**
6. Summary:
> Add summary here!
```
